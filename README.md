### Abstract

Geometric morphometric techniques are a collection of tools which allows visualization and quantification of shape changes among biological forms. 2D landmark-based configurations extracted from limbs and trunk images of children aged 6-59 months have been recently designed in order to study morphological variation related to ontogenetic and populational factors. Furthermore, such new templates registering children shape variation have been used to analyse acute malnutrition shape pattern, together with optimal nutritional condition’s one. A linear discriminant analysis was performed to build a classification method for assessing whether target children could be malnourished or not (in press). This project is called SAM Photo Diagnosis App Project® and has been developed by Action Against Hunger since October 2015. All methods developed by SAM Photo project were programmed in a smartphone App with the aim of providing communities worldwide an offline easy to use screening tool for acute malnutrition. This Master's thesis reviews the current classification and methodological techniques used in the field, presents new ones and performs an exhaustive and quantitative analysis of the methodologies applied to children malnutrition detection from a body picture improving the state-of-the-art classification results up to 10% and detecting age and sex groups especially sensitive to misdiagnoses.
