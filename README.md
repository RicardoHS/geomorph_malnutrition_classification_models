### Abstract

Geometric morphometric techniques are a collection of tools which allows visualization and quantification of shape changes among biological forms [1]. 2D landmark-based configurations extracted from limbs and trunk images of children aged 6-59 months have been recently designed in order to study morphological variation related to ontogenetic and populational factors [2].
 Furthermore, such new templates registering children shape variation have been used to analyse acute malnutrition shape pattern, together with optimal nutritional condition’s one. A linear discriminant analysis was performed to build a classification method for assessing whether target children could be malnourished or not (in press).
All methods developed by this project were programmed in a smartphone App with the aim of providing communities worldwide an offline easy to use screening tool for acute malnutrition. This project is called SAM Photo Diagnosis App Project® and has been developed by Action Against Hunger since October 2015. Currently, the project is validating the prototype smart App and a wide range of new children data are being collected, considering sex, age and nutritional status, with the aim of identifying at least four categories of nutritional status. 
This Master’s Thesis will consist on a revision of the existing classification methods for four groups and an empirical comparison study of their performances under different scenarios, with the possibility of proposing some extensions.
